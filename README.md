# Weather Dashboard

## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a web application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, Google Fonts, and the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) APIs.

Users enter a city name, and OpenWeatherMap's [Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) converts the city name to coordinates. The coordinates are then used to get the current weather from OpenWeatherMap's [Current Weather Data API](https://openweathermap.org/current), and the Five Day Forecast from OpenWeatherMap's [5 Day Weather Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5).

When users search a city, the city's name is saved in local storage and displayed on the page. Users may then click on a previously searched city to redisplay its forecast.
